### UI Polish Ideas
**Medium Priority:**
- Subtle curator mode expand/collapse animations
- Auto-save drafts if user accidentally closes
- Graceful LLM timeout handling with better error messaging

**Lower Priority:**
- First-time onboarding tooltip sequence
- Visual loading states and spinners
- Offline mode messaging and handling

### Advanced Features
- Multiple note categories/tags
- Search functionality across saved notes
- Export options (PDF, markdown, etc.)
- Plugin architecture for extensions

## Implementation Notes

Keep all additions **optional** and maintain the core philosophy:
- Frictionless thought capture
- Minimal cognitive overhead
- Instant availability (< 2 second spawn)
- No interruption to workflow

Priority should always be given to speed and simplicity over feature richness.
